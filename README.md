✨Elucidation of My Scheme:

Project Name –** CHRONICLE**

## Function 
This app *CHRONICLE* will contain the database of all the entities registered in the university/school. Basically, this application will be accessed only by the higher authorities of the organization, who will be dealing with the information of all the students and faculties related. It will keep a record of all information that is important and need to be noted! 


## Key Features
- App will allow the admins to directly add, delete, or update any data regarding the people, instead of dealing with the rows and columns of a spreadsheet or maintain a register.
- Bona-fide, Transfer Letter, Fee Receipt, Leaving Certificate, Result or any other Forms can be printed easily without changing the existing common format available as usual.
- Bio of each entity can be updated via including awards, honors, and appreciation letters through the app itself!
- Any recent information regarding the person can be downloaded and sent as a PDF.
- Specific people under restricted fields can be sorted easily.


## Main Updation
- This application will also have multiple universities/schools linked to each other. (Not sharing the confidential information, just keeping it clear with the basic data).
- Different organizations can connect to different ones via mailing them through the app and sharing each other’s required facts for events like interschool competitions, or collaboration projects.
- Information about people of different schools/colleges can be combined in one group easily.


## SCQ Probe

### S (Situation)
- Maintaining big excel sheets and registers is way more hectic and time-consuming, which can be covered here.
- Connecting different communities in one app, hasn’t made before, which is quite interesting here!
- Getting data handy in one go can be made possible.
- Existing apps/websites of desired institutions work on the internet. This app lets the user get data of any entity offline as well!
	
### C (Challenges)
- To write the existing data of n number of entities of a particular institution.
- To create different view levels for this app for higher authorities, admins, and teachers.

### Q (Questions)
- What makes this different from the already created app/webpages of the dedicated universities/schools?
